# SOSwipeCell

After the launch of iOS 7, Apple introduced a great user interface in their Mail app. This feature allowed to swipe left and right that revealed multiple options to take certain action such as Delete, archive, flag, etc. 

Also, I have created a demo on it and written a tutorial [Creating Custom Swipe to Delete iOS Feature Using iOS TableView](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/custom-swipe-delete-ios-tableview/).

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS app and looking to [hire swift developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-swift-developer/ ) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
